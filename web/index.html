<h1>cwdrill</h1>

<p>A really, really basic Morse code/CW trainer for the Linux CLI.
</p><p>
Released into the public domain, because it's so simple, it's
borderline not-actually-copyrightable.
</p><p>
It's intended to be run on a large terminal, while you do something
from the other side of the room.  It doesn't do anything but play
morse code and then print the letter on the terminal window.
</p><p>
There may be a nearly-useless demo video up at<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3G8MiEa0GY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3G8MiEa0GY</a>
</p><p>
You can check out the source code via a <tt>git clone</tt> of <a href="cwdrill.git/">cwdrill.git/ under this directory</a> ("Copy link target" and git clone it).
</p><p>
The program is in code/; go in there and run 
</p><p>
  cwdrill_cli.pl
</p><p>
You'll need to have cwwav installed (see
<a href="https://github.com/Kerrick/cwwav/">https://github.com/Kerrick/cwwav/</a>) as well as <tt>banner(1)</tt> (on Ubuntu and
probably Debian, try '<tt>sudo apt-get install sysvbanner</tt>').
</p><p>
I'm pretty sure I just spent longer writing this readme than I did on
writing the program.
</p><p>
Good luck.  If it's broken on your system, you may keep all the
pieces.
