cwdrill
=======

A really, really basic Morse code/CW trainer for the Linux CLI.

Released into the public domain, because it's so simple, it's
borderline not-actually-copyrightable.

It's intended to be run on a large terminal, while you do something
from the other side of the room.  It doesn't do anything but play
morse code and then print the letter on the terminal window.

There may be a nearly-useless demo video up at 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3G8MiEa0GY

The program is in code/; go in there and run 

  cwdrill_cli.pl

You'll need to have cwwav installed (see
https://github.com/Kerrick/cwwav/) as well as banner(1) (on Ubuntu and
probably Debian, try 'sudo apt-get install sysvbanner').

I'm pretty sure I just spent longer writing this readme than I did on
writing the program.

Good luck.  If it's broken on your system, you may keep all the
pieces.

(This is an undertaker project.  Undertaker is a tool for managing the 
open source development/publishing/release process, which pulls your 
source code, documentation, blog posts, etc, all into a single static 
"gitball" for release.  It can also generate static websites from 
locally-dynamic files, allowing you to have a project blog that looks
dynamic but is actually statically published.  This makes your content
very friendly to archiving by tools like the wayback machine, and also
to indexing by web crawlers.  You can also publish all your content via
trivial static webservers, including CDNs or just local files.
